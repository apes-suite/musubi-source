“Particle imaging velocimetry experiments and lattice-Boltzmann simulations on
a single sphere settling under gravity,” Physics of Fluids, vol. 14, no. 11,
pp. 4012–4025, Nov. 2002, doi: 10.1063/1.1512918.

Simulations are done using the fully resolved Momentum-Exchange Method (MEM)
and are reported in our publication:
