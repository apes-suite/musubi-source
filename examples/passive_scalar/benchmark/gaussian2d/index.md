title: Gaussian 2D

## Gaussian 2D ## {#ex_gaussian2d}

This example simulates the diffusion of a passive scalar with an initial Gaussian distribution in a 2D domain. It serves as a benchmark for testing numerical methods for passive scalar transport and diffusion. The simulation can be configured for both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion scenarios.
