The objective of the channel 3D examples are to introduce the following
features in Musubi:

* List general informations here.


Here is the list of test cases to learn these features in Musubi:

* [Simple](C3D_Simple/index.html)
* Flow around the cylinder
    * [Single-level](C3D_Cylinder_SingleLevel/index.html)
    * [Multi-level](C3D_Cylinder_MultiLevel/index.html)
    * [Sponge](C3D_Cylinder_Sponge/index.html)

In these test cases, in addition to the aforementioned features, you will also
learn how to:

* Create a mesh with boundaries using Seeder.
* Post-processing nd visualization in Paraview.
* Create a 2D plot using Gleaner tool. Gleaner is a Python tool which
