# Lid driven cavity in 2D with multilevel#

Lid-driven cavity is a simple 2D problem with simple boundary conditions.
In a square domain, dirichlet boundary conditions are set on all sides.
Fixed wall (\( \vec{u} = 0\)) boundary conditions on 3 sides (west, east and
south) and moving wall (\( u_x = u_c, u_y = 0\)) boundary condition on north
side.
