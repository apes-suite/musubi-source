# Poisueille flow in a channel 2D using different bgk collision schemes# {#eg_C2D_Simple}

In this example, we will investigate the Poiseuille flow in a plain 2D channel.
The objectives of this example is to introduce how to:

* Create a mesh with boundaries using Seeder.
* Post-process the mesh using Seeder-harvester and visualize it Paraview.
* Simulate Poiseuille flow in the channel using Musubi.
* Use different bgk collision schemes (see 'Recommendations' below).
* Validate the numerical results.
* Visualize the flow in Paraview.
* Create a 2D plot using Gleaner tool. Gleaner is a Python tool which
extracts data from Musubi ascii output and uses matplotlib in python library
to create a plot.

Here is the list of test cases to learn these features in Musbi and some hints
on when to use what:

## Problem description ##

The Poiseuille flow is the fully developed laminar flow between two parallel
plates induced by a constant pressure drop in a channel of length L.
In general, the flow can be induced by any of the following way:

* Defining pressure at inlet and outlet of the channel.
* Defining velocity at inlet and pressure at outlet of the channel.
  [Here](../C2D_BoundaryConditions/BC_VeNonEqExpol_PressNonEqExpol/index.html)
  is the example.
* Using pressure gradient i.e. pressure drop/length as a external force.
  [Here](../C2D_Force/index.html) is the example.

Here, the flow is induced by pressure boundary condition at inlet (west)
and outlet (east) boundaries as shown in figure below.
![channel2DSetup](media/channel2DSetup.png "Geometry configuration for Channel 2D")

The pressure drop along the channel per unit length is
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\nabla p}{L} = \frac{p_{inlet} - p_{outlet}}{L}
  = \frac{8 \mathbf{U}_m \rho\nu}{H^2}
\end{equation}
where,

* \( \mathbf{U}_m \) - the maximum fluid velocity at the channel center axis,
* \( \rho=1.0 \) - the fluid density and
* \( \nu=10^{-3} m^2/s \) - kinematic viscosity.

The Reynolds number is defined as
\begin{equation}
  Re=\frac{\mathbf{\bar U} H}{\nu}
\end{equation}
where, \( \bar{U} \) - the mean velocity.
For the parabolic velocity profile, the mean velocity can be computed with
\( \mathbf{\bar U} = 2 \mathbf{U}_m /3 \).

The analytical velocity profile along channel height is given as
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{U}(x,y) = \frac{4 \mathbf{U}_m y (H-y)}{H^2},
\end{equation}
the analytical pressure profile along the channel length is
\begin{equation}
  p(x,y) = p_0 + \nabla p (L-x)
\end{equation}
and wall shear stress profile along the channel height is
\begin{equation}
  \sigma = \frac{2 \nu |y-H/2| \mathbf{U}_m}{(H/2)^2}.
\end{equation}
The error between analytical solution (\( u_a \)) and simulated results
(\( u_s \)) are defined by the \( L^2 \) relative error norm as
\begin{equation}
  L^2\ relative\ error\ norm =
   \sqrt {\frac{\sum_i (u_a(i) - u_s(i) )^2}{\sum_i u_a(i)^2}}.
\end{equation}
