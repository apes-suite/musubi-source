# Turbulent flow around the sphere in a channel 3D # {#eg_C3D_Cylinder_MultiLevel_LES}

In this example, we will investigate the turbulent flow around the cylinder
in a 3D channel for Re=3900.
The objectives of this example is to introduce how to:

* Create a mesh with boundaries using Seeder.
* Post-process the mesh using Seeder-Harvester and visualize it with Paraview.
* Simulate the flow in the channel using Musubi.
* Validate the numerical results.
* Visualize the flow in Paraview.
