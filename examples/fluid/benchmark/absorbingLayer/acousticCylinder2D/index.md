title: Acoustic Line Source

## Acoustic 2D line source for plane absorbing layer ## {ex_fluid_abslayer_lineSrc}

This test case provides an example for using absorbing layer at outlet boundary.
The fluctuating pressure field is defined at the west boundary and 
background pressure is defined at the east boundary. The planar absorbing layer
is defined at the east boundary with a thickness of 0.8.
