title: Acoustic pulse 2D with absorbing layer radial

## Acoustic pulse 2D with absorbing layer radial ## {ex_fluid_abslayer_pulse2D_radial}

The predefined spatial function "absorblayer_radial" creates radial absorbing
layer which is best suited to absorb acoustic waves generated at the center
of the domain.
